## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

## Background Context

Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human error… Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve. Any great Software Engineer must learn from his/her mistakes to make sure that they won’t happen again. Failing is fine, but failing twice because of the same issue is not.

A postmortem is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any outage, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a summary that has 2 main goals:

To provide the rest of the company’s employees easy access to information detailing the cause of the outage. Often outages can have a huge impact on a company, so managers and executives have to understand what happened and how it will impact their work.
And to ensure that the root cause(s) of the outage has been discovered and that measures are taken to make sure it will be fixed.
